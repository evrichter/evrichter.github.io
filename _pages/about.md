I am a data expert trainee at Previsionz Saarbruecken. I obtained my Master's in Language Science and Technology from Saarland University. During my studies I gained both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, psycholinguistics, and speech technology.
I also completed two exchange semesters â€” at Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona) and Charles University (Prague) â€” where I not only deepened my academic skills in NLP but also broadened my perspective by experiencing new cultures and languages.  

As a trainee at the European Parliament in Brussels, I worked on the evaluation of a live speech-to-text and machine translation system. very interestung for me bc comined nlp background with impact of language technologies in making parliamentary debates more inclusive. 

Before my masterâ€™s, I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Linguistics and Translation from Saarland University, where I studied core areas of linguistics, learned to apply CAT tools in translation workflows, and gained my first exposure to AI and language technology through my bachelorâ€™s thesis on the evaluation of machine translation output.

Ever since, I have been fascinated by how technology can process complex language and support communication and I am motivated to apply my knowledge and continue growing in the fields of language, data, and AI.
