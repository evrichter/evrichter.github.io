I'm Eva🙂. Currently, I work in the field of *Data Analytics*, where I focus on understanding data, building models, and creating visualizations. This website is mainly a personal space for me to keep track of projects, ideas, and things I am learning along the way.

My academic background is in *Language Science and Technology*, where I studied how language can be processed by computers. During my Master’s at Saarland University, I gained knowledge of different topics in the fields of *language technology*, *natural language processing* and *psycholinguistics*.
As part of my studies, I spent two exchange semesters at *Pompeu Fabra University* (Barcelona) and *Charles University* (Prague), and completed a traineeship at the *European Parliament* in Brussels. These experiences allowed me to work more deeply on NLP-related topics and gain experience in international and interdisciplinary settings.

Before that, I studied *Linguistics and Translation* at Saarland University, focusing on core linguistic areas such as phonetics and pragmatics, as well as translation technologies and CAT tools. My bachelor’s thesis on *machine translation evaluation* was my first exposure to language technology and AI.

Ever since, I have been fascinated by how technology can process complex language and support human communication. While I work in a *business intelligence*–focused role, I remain especially interested in NLP applications, with a particular focus on *AI in healthcare* as well as *cognitive language processing*.

In my free time, I love learning new languages, travelling and taking *(too many😄)* photos along the way.
